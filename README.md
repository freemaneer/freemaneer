- 👋 Hi, I’m @freemaneer
- 👀 I’m interested in practicing my Java, Python, and C++ skills and learning Javascript, frameworks like Spring boot, etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to get going on Github...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that won't result in death threats!
- 📫 How to reach me freebuseer@gmail.com (It's less crowded than my freemaneer@gmail.com)
